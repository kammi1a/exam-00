# Examination System


## Description
The Exam System is an application built with Java, PostgreSQL, and JDBC, designed to manage online tests efficiently. It allows users to register, choose their subjects and categories, and take tests. After completing the test, the system calculates and displays the score in real-time. All user data, test questions, and results are stored in a PostgreSQL database, and JDBC ensures smooth communication between the Java application and the database.
